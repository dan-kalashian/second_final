This is the README file for my second final project.
This project has no user inputs

The numbers.py file creates an array then prints that array, then prints that array with values doubled.
The program then works with the iris data using pandas, and prints various data frames
The program then takes a dictionary, converts it to a pandas data frame, and exports that as a CSV

Thank you for reading!
